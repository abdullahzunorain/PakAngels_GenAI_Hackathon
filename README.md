### **Weather-Based Outfit Suggestion App**

The **Weather-Based Outfit Suggestion App** is a personalized tool designed to help users pick the perfect outfit based on various factors such as local weather conditions, personal style, fabric preferences, time of day, and planned activities. By entering their location, users get daily, tailored outfit recommendations that simplify their morning routine and ensure they are dressed appropriately and comfortably.

#### **Features:**
- **Weather-based Outfit Suggestions:** The app analyzes location-specific weather data to suggest outfits that are suitable for the weather, such as sunny, rainy, or chilly conditions.
- **Personalized Style:** Users can input their unique style preferences (e.g., traditional, formal) for tailored suggestions that match their taste.
- **Fabric Choice:** The app allows users to choose preferred fabrics (e.g., cotton, linen) to ensure comfort throughout the day.
- **Activity-based Suggestions:** Outfit recommendations vary based on the activity the user plans to engage in (e.g., work, exercise, casual outing).
- **Time of Day:** Outfit suggestions are customized for different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) to ensure they are appropriate for the user's schedule and weather conditions.
